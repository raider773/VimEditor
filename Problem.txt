Problem:

We have five houses of five different colours and in each of them lives a person with a different profession. Each
one programs in a different language, uses a different NoSQL database, and uses a different text editor.

You have the following clues:
1. There are 5 houses.
2. The Mathematician lives in the red house.
3. The hacker programs in Python.
4. The Brackets is used in the green house.
5. The analyst uses Atom.
6. The green house is to the right of the white house.
7. The person using Redis programs in Java.
8. Cassandra is used in the yellow house.
9. Notepad++ is used in the middle house.
10. The Developer lives in the first house.
11. The person who uses HBase lives next door to the person who programs JavaScript.
12. The person using Cassandra is a neighbor of the person programming in C#.
13. The person using Neo4J uses Sublime Text.
14. The Engineer uses MongoDB.
15. The developer lives in the blue house.

Answer: Who uses the Vim editor?


Logic:
    
    colours : red,green,white,yellow,blue
    professions: Mathematician,hacker,analyst,Developer,Engineer
    languajes: Python,java,javascript,c#,OtherLanguage
    noSQL: Redis,Cassandra,HBase,Neo4J,MongoDB
    editor: Atom,Brackets,Notepad++,sublimeText,VIM

    Chromosomes consists of an arrangement of houses, with the genes colour, profession,language,NoSQL and text editor
    Algorithm will learn the best arrangement and the best attributes for each house given the aptitude function    
    
    chromosome : [{colour:,profession:,language:,NoSQL:,textEditor:}, {colour:,....},....]  
    5 elements (5 houses). algorithm sorts elements and attributes inside each element    
    
    colours: 
    professions:
    languajes:
    NoSQL:
    Editor:
    
    Rules for aptitude function:
        
           Each rule sums 1 to the total
           
           Rules:
           
               profession:math && colour:red **same element
               profession:hacker && language:python **same element
               editor:bracket && colour:green **same element
               profession:aanlyst && editor:Atom **same element
               [colour:white] then [colour:green] 
               database:redis && language:java **same element
               databse:cassandra && colour:yellow
               editor:Notepadd++ in house index == 2
               0 index profession:developer
               database:HBase before or after element with language:javascript
               database:Cassandra before or after element with language:c#
               database:Neo4j && editor:sublime text  **same element
               profession engeneer && database:MongoDB **same element
               profession:developer && colour:blue **same element
